Using both a t-test and a simple linear regression, we find no statistically significant difference between the groups:\n\n- The t-test yields t = 0.120, p = 0.905.\n- The regression coefficient on the treatment indicator is 0.014 (p = 0.905).\n\nThis confirms the results are consistent across both methods, as expected. These findings support the randomization validity and are in line with Table 1 in Karlan & List (2007), which demonstrates that observable donor characteristics are well balanced across experimental arms.\n```{python}\n\nvar = 'years'\n\n\ntreated = df[df['treatment'] == 1][var].dropna()\ncontrol = df[df['treatment'] == 0][var].dropna()\n\n\nt_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(treated, control, equal_var=False)\nprint(f\"t-test for {var}:\")\nprint(f\"t = {t_stat:.3f}, p = {p_val:.4f}\")\n\n\nmodel = smf.ols(f\"{var} ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(f\"\\nLinear regression for {var} ~ treatment:\")\nprint(model.summary().tables[1])\n```\nWe next test for balance on the variable `years`, which measures the number of years since the individual’s first donation.\n\n- The independent samples t-test yields t = -1.091 with p = 0.275, indicating no significant difference.\n- A linear regression of `years` on the `treatment` indicator produces a coefficient of -0.0575 (p = 0.270).\n\nBoth methods confirm that this variable is well balanced across treatment and control groups. This result is consistent with Table 1 in Karlan & List (2007), and supports the success of the random assignment procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Experimental Results\n\n### Charitable Contribution Made\n\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation. \n\n\n```{python}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndonation_rate = df.groupby('treatment')['gave'].mean()\n\n\ndonation_rate.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.xticks([0, 1], ['Control', 'Treatment'], rotation=0)\nplt.title(\"Donation Rate by Treatment Group\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Proportion who donated\")\nplt.show()\n\n```\n\n\n```{python}\ntreated = df[df['treatment'] == 1]['gave']\ncontrol = df[df['treatment'] == 0]['gave']\n\n\nt_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(treated, control, equal_var=False)\nprint(f\"t-test for gave: t = {t_stat:.3f}, p = {p_val:.4f}\")\n\n\nmodel_linear = smf.ols(\"gave ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(\"\\nLinear regression result:\")\nprint(model_linear.summary().tables[1])\n\n```\n\n```{python}\nmodel_probit = smf.probit(\"gave ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(\"\\nProbit regression result:\")\nprint(model_probit.summary().tables[1])\n```\n### Charitable Contribution Made\n\nWe examine whether offering a matching donation increases the likelihood of charitable giving. First, we create a bar plot comparing the donation rates between the treatment and control groups. The treatment group exhibits a higher response rate (2.21%) compared to the control group (1.79%).\n\nTo formally test the difference, we conduct a t-test and a bivariate linear regression. The t-test yields a statistically significant result (t = 3.209, p = 0.0013), indicating that the difference in donation rates is unlikely to be due to chance. The regression confirms this finding, showing that the treatment increases the probability of giving by 0.42 percentage points (p = 0.002).\n\nWe further estimate a probit model to mirror Table 3, column 1 of Karlan and List (2007). The probit regression yields a treatment coefficient of 0.0868 (p = 0.002), confirming that assignment to the matching treatment significantly increases the likelihood of donation.\n\nThese results support the paper’s main finding: merely mentioning that a donation will be matched is enough to boost giving behavior. This highlights the power of framing and suggests that perceived leverage or impact motivates donors.\n\n### Differences between Match Rates\n\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\n\n```{python}\n\ngave_11 = df[(df['ratio2'] == 0) & (df['ratio3'] == 0)]['gave']\ngave_21 = df[df['ratio2'] == 1]['gave']\ngave_31 = df[df['ratio3'] == 1]['gave']\n\n\nprint(\"T-tests comparing match ratios:\")\nt1, p1 = stats.ttest_ind(gave_11, gave_21, equal_var=False)\nprint(f\"1:1 vs 2:1  --> t = {t1:.3f}, p = {p1:.4f}\")\n\nt2, p2 = stats.ttest_ind(gave_21, gave_31, equal_var=False)\nprint(f\"2:1 vs 3:1  --> t = {t2:.3f}, p = {p2:.4f}\")\n\n\nmodel = smf.ols(\"gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3\", data=df).fit()\nprint(\"\\nLinear regression for match ratios:\")\nprint(model.summary().tables[1])\n\n\nrate_11 = gave_11.mean()\nrate_21 = gave_21.mean()\nrate_31 = gave_31.mean()\nprint(\"\\nResponse rate differences:\")\nprint(f\"2:1 - 1:1 = {rate_21 - rate_11:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"3:1 - 2:1 = {rate_31 - rate_21:.4f}\")\n```\n\nWe evaluate whether higher match ratios increase the likelihood of donating. The 1:1 match rate serves as the baseline.\n\nFirst, using a t-test, we find a statistically significant increase in donation likelihood when moving from a 1:1 to a 2:1 match (p = 0.0265), but no significant difference between 2:1 and 3:1 (p = 0.9600).\n\nA regression of the binary outcome `gave` on match ratio indicators confirms this. The coefficients on `ratio2` and `ratio3` are 0.0036 and 0.0037, respectively, both significant at the 5% level. This suggests that increasing the match rate from 1:1 to 2:1 increases the probability of donation by roughly 0.36 percentage points. However, moving from 2:1 to 3:1 yields virtually no further increase.\n\nThese findings support the interpretation on page 8 of Karlan and List (2007): while match offers boost giving, larger match ratios do not meaningfully outperform the simple 1:1 match.\n\n### Size of Charitable Contribution\n\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\n\n```{python}\nmodel_all = smf.ols(\"amount ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(\"Regression on full sample:\")\nprint(model_all.summary().tables[1])\n```\n_todo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients -- what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?_ \n```{python}\ndf_positive = df[df['amount'] > 0]\nmodel_donors = smf.ols(\"amount ~ treatment\", data=df_positive).fit()\nprint(\"\\nRegression on donors only:\")\nprint(model_donors.summary().tables[1])\n```\n_todo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot._\n```{python}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Donation histograms for treatment and control (positive donations only)\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5), sharey=True)\n\nfor i, group in enumerate([0, 1]):\n    subset = df[(df['treatment'] == group) & (df['amount'] > 0)]['amount']\n    axs[i].hist(subset, bins=30, alpha=0.7)\n    axs[i].axvline(subset.mean(), color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)\n    axs[i].set_title(f\"{'Control' if group == 0 else 'Treatment'} Group\")\n    axs[i].set_xlabel(\"Donation Amount\")\n    axs[i].set_ylabel(\"Number of Donors\")\n\nplt.suptitle(\"Donation Amounts among Donors\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n### Size of Charitable Contribution\n\nWe assess whether the treatment affected not just the likelihood of giving, but also the size of donations.\n\nWe first estimate a regression on the full sample, including those who gave zero. The coefficient on `treatment` is 0.1536 (p = 0.063), suggesting that the match treatment may have slightly increased average donations, though the effect is marginally insignificant at the 5% level.\n\nWhen restricting the sample to only those who donated (i.e., positive donation amounts), we find a treatment coefficient of -1.67 (p = 0.561), indicating no significant difference in donation size among donors. This is consistent with the notion that the treatment primarily affected whether people gave, rather than how much they gave.\n\nTo visualize this, we plot histograms of donation amounts among donors, separated by treatment status. Both distributions are highly right-skewed. The mean donation is visually indicated by a red dashed line in each plot, showing similar average levels.\n\nThese findings imply that the matching grant mainly served as a behavioral nudge to increase participation, rather than changing the generosity of individual donors. The treatment coefficient in the restricted sample cannot be interpreted causally, since it conditions on post-treatment behavior (i.e., giving).\n\n## Simulation Experiment\n\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic \"works,\" in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made. \n\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size  is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\n### Law of Large Numbers\n\n\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n# 10000 draws for each group\nn = 10000\ncontrol = np.random.binomial(1, 0.018, n)\ntreatment = np.random.binomial(1, 0.022, n)\n\ndiffs = treatment - control\ncumulative_avg = np.cumsum(diffs) / np.arange(1, n + 1)\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nplt.plot(cumulative_avg, label=\"Cumulative average\")\nplt.axhline(0.004, color='red', linestyle='--', label=\"True diff (0.022 - 0.018)\")\nplt.title(\"LLN Simulation: Cumulative Avg of Differences\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Simulation draws\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Cumulative average difference\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Central Limit Theorem\n\n\n\n```{python}\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\n\nfor i, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):\n    means = []\n    for _ in range(1000):\n        c = np.random.binomial(1, 0.018, n)\n        t = np.random.binomial(1, 0.022, n)\n        means.append(t.mean() - c.mean())\n    \n    plt.subplot(2, 2, i+1)\n    plt.hist(means, bins=30, edgecolor='black')\n    plt.axvline(0, color='red', linestyle='--')\n    plt.title(f\"CLT: Sample Size = {n}\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"Mean Difference\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.suptitle(\"CLT Simulation: Sampling Distributions\", y=1.02)\nplt.show()\n```\n### Simulation Experiment\n\nTo illustrate the mechanics of the t-statistic and reinforce key statistical concepts, we conduct simulations that demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).\n\n#### Law of Large Numbers\n\nWe simulate 10,000 draws from two Bernoulli distributions: one representing the control group with probability 0.018 of giving, and one representing the treatment group with probability 0.022. At each iteration, we compute the difference in outcomes and plot the cumulative average of these differences.\n\nAs expected, the cumulative average converges toward the true difference in means (0.004). This visualizes the Law of Large Numbers, showing how repeated random samples stabilize around the population parameter.\n\n#### Central Limit Theorem\n\nWe simulate 1000 differences in sample means between treatment and control groups at four different sample sizes: 50, 200, 500, and 1000. For each simulation, we draw n observations from each group and compute the average difference.\n\nThe resulting histograms clearly show that as sample size increases, the distribution of sample mean differences becomes narrower and more symmetric around the true value. At n = 1000, the distribution is nearly normal. These results validate the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches normality as the sample size increases—even when the underlying distribution is Bernoulli.\n\nTogether, these simulations highlight the theoretical foundations that support our statistical inferences throughout this experiment.\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nDean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007.

Using both a t-test and a simple linear regression, we find no statistically significant difference between the groups:\n\n- The t-test yields t = 0.120, p = 0.905.\n- The regression coefficient on the treatment indicator is 0.014 (p = 0.905).\n\nThis confirms the results are consistent across both methods, as expected. These findings support the randomization validity and are in line with Table 1 in Karlan & List (2007), which demonstrates that observable donor characteristics are well balanced across experimental arms.\n```{python}\n\nvar = 'years'\n\n\ntreated = df[df['treatment'] == 1][var].dropna()\ncontrol = df[df['treatment'] == 0][var].dropna()\n\n\nt_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(treated, control, equal_var=False)\nprint(f\"t-test for {var}:\")\nprint(f\"t = {t_stat:.3f}, p = {p_val:.4f}\")\n\n\nmodel = smf.ols(f\"{var} ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(f\"\\nLinear regression for {var} ~ treatment:\")\nprint(model.summary().tables[1])\n```\nWe next test for balance on the variable `years`, which measures the number of years since the individual’s first donation.\n\n- The independent samples t-test yields t = -1.091 with p = 0.275, indicating no significant difference.\n- A linear regression of `years` on the `treatment` indicator produces a coefficient of -0.0575 (p = 0.270).\n\nBoth methods confirm that this variable is well balanced across treatment and control groups. This result is consistent with Table 1 in Karlan & List (2007), and supports the success of the random assignment procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Experimental Results\n\n### Charitable Contribution Made\n\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation. \n\n\n```{python}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndonation_rate = df.groupby('treatment')['gave'].mean()\n\n\ndonation_rate.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.xticks([0, 1], ['Control', 'Treatment'], rotation=0)\nplt.title(\"Donation Rate by Treatment Group\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Proportion who donated\")\nplt.show()\n\n```\n\n\n```{python}\ntreated = df[df['treatment'] == 1]['gave']\ncontrol = df[df['treatment'] == 0]['gave']\n\n\nt_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(treated, control, equal_var=False)\nprint(f\"t-test for gave: t = {t_stat:.3f}, p = {p_val:.4f}\")\n\n\nmodel_linear = smf.ols(\"gave ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(\"\\nLinear regression result:\")\nprint(model_linear.summary().tables[1])\n\n```\n\n```{python}\nmodel_probit = smf.probit(\"gave ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(\"\\nProbit regression result:\")\nprint(model_probit.summary().tables[1])\n```\n### Charitable Contribution Made\n\nWe examine whether offering a matching donation increases the likelihood of charitable giving. First, we create a bar plot comparing the donation rates between the treatment and control groups. The treatment group exhibits a higher response rate (2.21%) compared to the control group (1.79%).\n\nTo formally test the difference, we conduct a t-test and a bivariate linear regression. The t-test yields a statistically significant result (t = 3.209, p = 0.0013), indicating that the difference in donation rates is unlikely to be due to chance. The regression confirms this finding, showing that the treatment increases the probability of giving by 0.42 percentage points (p = 0.002).\n\nWe further estimate a probit model to mirror Table 3, column 1 of Karlan and List (2007). The probit regression yields a treatment coefficient of 0.0868 (p = 0.002), confirming that assignment to the matching treatment significantly increases the likelihood of donation.\n\nThese results support the paper’s main finding: merely mentioning that a donation will be matched is enough to boost giving behavior. This highlights the power of framing and suggests that perceived leverage or impact motivates donors.\n\n### Differences between Match Rates\n\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\n\n```{python}\n\ngave_11 = df[(df['ratio2'] == 0) & (df['ratio3'] == 0)]['gave']\ngave_21 = df[df['ratio2'] == 1]['gave']\ngave_31 = df[df['ratio3'] == 1]['gave']\n\n\nprint(\"T-tests comparing match ratios:\")\nt1, p1 = stats.ttest_ind(gave_11, gave_21, equal_var=False)\nprint(f\"1:1 vs 2:1  --> t = {t1:.3f}, p = {p1:.4f}\")\n\nt2, p2 = stats.ttest_ind(gave_21, gave_31, equal_var=False)\nprint(f\"2:1 vs 3:1  --> t = {t2:.3f}, p = {p2:.4f}\")\n\n\nmodel = smf.ols(\"gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3\", data=df).fit()\nprint(\"\\nLinear regression for match ratios:\")\nprint(model.summary().tables[1])\n\n\nrate_11 = gave_11.mean()\nrate_21 = gave_21.mean()\nrate_31 = gave_31.mean()\nprint(\"\\nResponse rate differences:\")\nprint(f\"2:1 - 1:1 = {rate_21 - rate_11:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"3:1 - 2:1 = {rate_31 - rate_21:.4f}\")\n```\n\nWe evaluate whether higher match ratios increase the likelihood of donating. The 1:1 match rate serves as the baseline.\n\nFirst, using a t-test, we find a statistically significant increase in donation likelihood when moving from a 1:1 to a 2:1 match (p = 0.0265), but no significant difference between 2:1 and 3:1 (p = 0.9600).\n\nA regression of the binary outcome `gave` on match ratio indicators confirms this. The coefficients on `ratio2` and `ratio3` are 0.0036 and 0.0037, respectively, both significant at the 5% level. This suggests that increasing the match rate from 1:1 to 2:1 increases the probability of donation by roughly 0.36 percentage points. However, moving from 2:1 to 3:1 yields virtually no further increase.\n\nThese findings support the interpretation on page 8 of Karlan and List (2007): while match offers boost giving, larger match ratios do not meaningfully outperform the simple 1:1 match.\n\n### Size of Charitable Contribution\n\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\n\n```{python}\nmodel_all = smf.ols(\"amount ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(\"Regression on full sample:\")\nprint(model_all.summary().tables[1])\n```\n_todo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients -- what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?_ \n```{python}\ndf_positive = df[df['amount'] > 0]\nmodel_donors = smf.ols(\"amount ~ treatment\", data=df_positive).fit()\nprint(\"\\nRegression on donors only:\")\nprint(model_donors.summary().tables[1])\n```\n_todo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot._\n```{python}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Donation histograms for treatment and control (positive donations only)\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5), sharey=True)\n\nfor i, group in enumerate([0, 1]):\n    subset = df[(df['treatment'] == group) & (df['amount'] > 0)]['amount']\n    axs[i].hist(subset, bins=30, alpha=0.7)\n    axs[i].axvline(subset.mean(), color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)\n    axs[i].set_title(f\"{'Control' if group == 0 else 'Treatment'} Group\")\n    axs[i].set_xlabel(\"Donation Amount\")\n    axs[i].set_ylabel(\"Number of Donors\")\n\nplt.suptitle(\"Donation Amounts among Donors\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n### Size of Charitable Contribution\n\nWe assess whether the treatment affected not just the likelihood of giving, but also the size of donations.\n\nWe first estimate a regression on the full sample, including those who gave zero. The coefficient on `treatment` is 0.1536 (p = 0.063), suggesting that the match treatment may have slightly increased average donations, though the effect is marginally insignificant at the 5% level.\n\nWhen restricting the sample to only those who donated (i.e., positive donation amounts), we find a treatment coefficient of -1.67 (p = 0.561), indicating no significant difference in donation size among donors. This is consistent with the notion that the treatment primarily affected whether people gave, rather than how much they gave.\n\nTo visualize this, we plot histograms of donation amounts among donors, separated by treatment status. Both distributions are highly right-skewed. The mean donation is visually indicated by a red dashed line in each plot, showing similar average levels.\n\nThese findings imply that the matching grant mainly served as a behavioral nudge to increase participation, rather than changing the generosity of individual donors. The treatment coefficient in the restricted sample cannot be interpreted causally, since it conditions on post-treatment behavior (i.e., giving).\n\n## Simulation Experiment\n\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic \"works,\" in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made. \n\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size  is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\n### Law of Large Numbers\n\n\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n# 10000 draws for each group\nn = 10000\ncontrol = np.random.binomial(1, 0.018, n)\ntreatment = np.random.binomial(1, 0.022, n)\n\ndiffs = treatment - control\ncumulative_avg = np.cumsum(diffs) / np.arange(1, n + 1)\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nplt.plot(cumulative_avg, label=\"Cumulative average\")\nplt.axhline(0.004, color='red', linestyle='--', label=\"True diff (0.022 - 0.018)\")\nplt.title(\"LLN Simulation: Cumulative Avg of Differences\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Simulation draws\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Cumulative average difference\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Central Limit Theorem\n\n\n\n```{python}\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\n\nfor i, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):\n    means = []\n    for _ in range(1000):\n        c = np.random.binomial(1, 0.018, n)\n        t = np.random.binomial(1, 0.022, n)\n        means.append(t.mean() - c.mean())\n    \n    plt.subplot(2, 2, i+1)\n    plt.hist(means, bins=30, edgecolor='black')\n    plt.axvline(0, color='red', linestyle='--')\n    plt.title(f\"CLT: Sample Size = {n}\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"Mean Difference\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.suptitle(\"CLT Simulation: Sampling Distributions\", y=1.02)\nplt.show()\n```\n### Simulation Experiment\n\nTo illustrate the mechanics of the t-statistic and reinforce key statistical concepts, we conduct simulations that demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).\n\n#### Law of Large Numbers\n\nWe simulate 10,000 draws from two Bernoulli distributions: one representing the control group with probability 0.018 of giving, and one representing the treatment group with probability 0.022. At each iteration, we compute the difference in outcomes and plot the cumulative average of these differences.\n\nAs expected, the cumulative average converges toward the true difference in means (0.004). This visualizes the Law of Large Numbers, showing how repeated random samples stabilize around the population parameter.\n\n#### Central Limit Theorem\n\nWe simulate 1000 differences in sample means between treatment and control groups at four different sample sizes: 50, 200, 500, and 1000. For each simulation, we draw n observations from each group and compute the average difference.\n\nThe resulting histograms clearly show that as sample size increases, the distribution of sample mean differences becomes narrower and more symmetric around the true value. At n = 1000, the distribution is nearly normal. These results validate the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches normality as the sample size increases—even when the underlying distribution is Bernoulli.\n\nTogether, these simulations highlight the theoretical foundations that support our statistical inferences throughout this experiment.\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
